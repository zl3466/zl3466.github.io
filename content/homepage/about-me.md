I am currently a senior undergraduate student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. 

At NYU, my research experiences have been predominantly focused on autonomous vehicle algorithms and datasets (AI4CE Lab, Department of Civil and Urban Engineering) and animal behavioral data acquisition and analysis (Wisniewski and Masurkar Labs, NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology). My future research and career aspirations thus lie in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and biomedical engineering.
