I am currently a MS ECE student at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously I attained my B.S. in ECE with minor in CS from NYU Tandon School of Engineering, working with Dr. Chen Feng at [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/) and Dr. Shuo Chen at [Chen Lab](https://shuolab.github.io/). 

My research experiences span developing vision models, datasets, and VLM/VLA for autonomous vehicles and general robotics, as well as animal behavioral data acquisition and analysis for neuroscience. My future research and career aspirations thus lie in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and biomedical engineering.
